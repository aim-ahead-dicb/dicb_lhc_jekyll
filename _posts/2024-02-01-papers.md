### Reviewing Methodologies for Evaluating Data Linkage Quality
This paper investigates how record linkage processes are reported in multimorbidity research, highlighting the prevalent inadequacies and potential biases due to poor reporting practices. It analyzes studies using linked routinely collected healthcare data and identifies the need for increased adherence to reporting deadlines. It emphasizes the requirement of detailed and transparent reporting to ensure data integrity and minimize bias, enhancing the reliability of multimorbidity research outcomes.

### Evaluating Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage and its Effects on Patient Data Overlap and Demographics in PCORnet
This article examines the implementation of privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) across the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, PCORnet. It features the significant patient overlap across the network and the changes in disease prevalence when records are linked. It also points out the value of PPRL in improving data accuracy, especially in cases of geaographical proximity among participants and extended study periods. The article is available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9933062/).

### Enhancing Research Power through Data Pooling and Harmonization
The paper emphasizes the significance of data pooling from multiple studies into a unified dataset, highlighting its potential to enhance statistical power and address novel research questions not feasible with individual datasets. The study describes data harmonization strategies applied to two pregnancy cohort studies in Alberta, Canada, aiming to investigate risk factors for preterm birth. The harmonization process involved extensive data processing, cleaning, and variable transformation to generate comparable datasets, demonstrating the utility and challenges associated with data harmonization in advancing research goals.

### FHIR-DHP Architecture Streamlines Data Harmonization for Seamless EHR and AI Collaboration
The FHIR-DHP (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Data Harmonization Pipeline) architecture offers a scalable protocol for harmonizing hospital EHR data through five stages, including querying, mapping to FHIR, syntactic validation, transferring to a patient-model database, and exporting in a custom JSON format. This process ensures correct data types, adherence to FHIR standards, and accessibility for common AI frameworks. The resulting output allows efficient data selection and filtering, facilitating integration with AI-based solutions in healthcare.

### Automated Methods for Enhancing and Curating Healthcare Data to Improve its Utility
The article explores a novel approach for enriching Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data using commercial consumer data, offering a repeatable process for data integration. It addresses challenges in mapping, linking, and analyzing SDOH information with clinical data. It demonstrates how incorporating individual-level SDOH factors improves patient care and treatment, focusing on the potential of consumer data in healthcare research and the necessity for innovative data curation techniques.

### Road to effective data curation for translational research
This paper emphasizes on the low reuse of clinical and translational research data due to the challenges in accessing and harmonizing datasets. Investments in clinical research data face challenges like legal hurdles and a lack of standardized practices, hindering data reuse. Efforts to improve curation, collaboration, and data management are crucial for enhancing the efficiency and impact of medical research.
