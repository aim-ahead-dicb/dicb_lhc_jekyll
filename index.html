    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The establishment of this research data repository is critical for supporting data linkage, standardization, and harmonization across diverse communities, especially those from historically marginalized backgrounds. This initiative will significantly enhance our understanding of unique health challenges these communities face, aligning with our North Star goals. These goals aim to promote diversity, equity, and inclusivity within the AI/ML workforce, broaden community knowledge and engagement in AI/ML, and build capacity to address community-specific health issues through AI/ML solutions.</p>
    
    <h2>Goals/Objectives</h2>
    <h3><strong>Aim 1: Establish a collaborative partnership between UTHealth, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.</strong></h3>
    <p>To achieve this aim, we will establish a strong collaboration between the three institutions, leveraging their expertise in medical information, data management, and infrastructure development. This partnership will involve regular communication, sharing of resources, and joint decision-making to ensure the successful development of the research data repository. We will conduct a detailed needs assessment to identify the necessary resources, expertise, and infrastructure required for the construction of the data repository. This will involve evaluating the current capabilities of each institution and identifying areas for improvement. Based on this assessment, we will develop a workforce development plan to train and equip personnel with the necessary skills and knowledge to construct and maintain the data repository.</p>
    
    <h3><strong>Aim 2: Enhance Data Linkage, Harmonization, and Standardization</strong></h3>
    <p>Building on the collaborative framework established in Aim 1, the second aim focuses on developing and implementing strategies for data linkage, harmonization, and standardization within the research data repository. This will involve formulating detailed protocols and standards to ensure data consistency and reliability across different datasets and sources. We will also design and integrate advanced technological solutions to facilitate efficient data management and interoperability. A comprehensive evaluation of existing data formats, privacy standards, and security protocols will be conducted to align all data practices with current best practices and regulatory requirements. This strategic approach will enable more effective data usage and increase the impact of research outcomes, thereby better addressing the health challenges faced by diverse communities.</p>
